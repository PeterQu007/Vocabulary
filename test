The President Next Door Ruff les Seoul SEOUL—When South Korea’s new leader vowed to relocate the presidential office to Lee In’s central Seoul neighborhood, the 35-year-old marketing freelancer felt a tinge of excitement. Local development, he thought, could finally flourish in the sleepy Yongsan district. Mr. Lee, whose apartment is steps from the new presidential office, underestimated the drawbacks of becoming president’s neighbor. “I can’t even open my windows because of the protesters yelling outside,” said Mr. Lee, who now wishes the office would go back to the old place a few miles away. One of Yoon Suk-yeol’s first acts after becoming president in May was to move the presidential office and residence out of the incumbent “Blue House” compound, named for its roof tiles’ color. The conservative Mr. Yoon, who eked out a March election victory, had pledged never to set foot inside the Blue House, a mountain-flanked complex used for decades that he likened to an emperor’s palace. It was too remote, he said, too detached from ordinary people. Now he’s too close for many South Koreans’ comfort. The new office sits in the heart of Seoul at the country’s Defense Ministry complex. His new residence lies just outside the complex. The new digs are in the riverside Yongsan neighborhood, where U.S. troops were stationed until a few years ago. The area is packed with homes, alleyway restaurants, government buildings and the Korean War museum. The neighborhood has turned into a protest zone for people with objections ranging from the presence of a U.S. antimissile system to Legoland Korea over a tiff about building the park above cultural artifacts. Oft-occurring presidential road blockages irk commuters and drivers. With crews still remodeling the residence—formerly the foreign minister’s—Mr. Yoon lives at his private home about 5 miles away, requiring him to crisscross Seoul to his office daily. A spokesman for Mr. Yoon’s office said: “The President is engaging in utmost efforts to minimize any inconvenience that the people might face during his commute.” Supporters of the move include Byun Gap-yeong, 70, who operates a small distribution center in Yongsan and said his business hasn’t been much affected: “Moving closer to the people and being able to meet and communicate with them is important.” The new venue needed major upgrades to accommodate a head of state. It lacks enough space for the increased police presence, local media reported, prompting some security officers to christen their cramped resting shelter the “Vinegar Room” for its human odors. Mr. Yoon’s spokesman, without directly commenting on the vinegar moniker, said it secured additional space “to improve the working and living conditions for the officers.” Some previous administrathe tions, too, have proposed moving out of the Blue House, including that of the liberal Roh Moo-hyun in the early 2000s. Mr. Yoon’s predecessor, Moon Jae-in, said he would move the presidential office to the nearby Gwanghwamun area. But his administration scrapped the plans, saying the alternative location lacked key facilities, among other factors. The 62-acre Blue House compound is three times the size of the White House grounds in Washington, D.C. The location, which Korean royalty had used as gardens for centuries, became the presidential complex after Korea divided. Off-limits for decades to all but the elite, the Blue House has become a tourist draw, with more than 1.4 million visitors in recent months, government data show. Lee Dohyun, a business manager living outside Seoul, strolled the grounds a few days after the Blue House opened to the public. “It felt amazing to see it in person,” said Mr. Lee, 32, who initially opposed the move but now approves after his Blue House visit. Still, he added, “Regardless of political orientation, I’m doubtful of whether it was a reasonable and efficient decision.” One dilemma is what to name the Blue House’s successor. The Yoon administration set up a committee that asked the public for suggestions, offering a roughly $4,500 cash prize for the winner. Approximately 30,000 entries flowed in. In June, the committee announced five finalists, including “The People’s House,” “The People’s Government Office,” “Bareunnuri” (“Righteous World”), and “Mineum Government Office,” (roughly, “Listening to the People”). The top vote-getter was “Itaewon-ro 22,” the street address, which critics on social media panned as a knockoff of the U.K.’s 10 Downing Street. None attracted a public consensus, so the committee concluded its activities without scheduling another meeting. That left the office with the interim name “Yongsan Presidential Office.” “Once we have a new name for the presidential office, we would use it for a long time,” said Mr. Yoon’s spokesman, so the office “decided to take more time to find a suitable name, rather than choosing hastily from the five candidate names.” Lee Yoon-jin, a 26-year-old sales manager, called the naming snafu “ridiculous.” Most South Koreans opposed the move, he said—in a March poll, 58% disapproved—“but Yoon still forced the move without any consent. It doesn’t feel democratic at all.” North Korea seized on how Mr. Yoon’s preferred placeholder, “People’s House,” was in English, not Korean. A Pyongyang-controlled propaganda website proposed: “Why don’t you change your name to Joseph Yoon and put a sign in front of the office saying ‘White House 2.0?’ ” The new office also lacks an official logo to replace the old one depicting the Blue House. Yoon administration officials have told local media that things would have moved faster if they hadn’t minimized costs to save taxpayer dollars. The budget for the move was roughly $37 million, and Mr. Yoon’s spokesman said the office was moving desks, chairs and other furniture from the Blue House to save money. One person not complaining is Cho Soon-ok, 80, who has staged solo protests, centered on a personal-property dispute, outside the Blue House since this past winter. She relocated her protests following Mr. Yoon’s move. The Blue House required a long uphill walk, she said, and the new site offers better access. And with a nearby subway station, she said, “Bathrooms are also much closer now.”
